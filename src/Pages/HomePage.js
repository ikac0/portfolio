            sometimes its hard to stay motivated during coding. at least the
            first few months. so i made a 3 weeks break. . maybe the reason for
            it was the pandemic, lack of social interaction, having no feedback
            for my clean-code, lack of confidence. i was waiting for the very
            last day to start applying for a job, knowing that i am running out
            of money, external pressure, and i'm punishing myself with
            restrictions.{" "}
